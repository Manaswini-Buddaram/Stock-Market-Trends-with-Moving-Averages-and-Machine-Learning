# Stock-Market-Trends-with-Moving-Averages-and-Machine-Learning
This project analyzes stock market data and implements a trading strategy using moving averages. It generates buy and sell signals when a short-term moving average crosses above or below a long-term moving average. The strategy is backtested using historical data and visualized with Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Backtrader.
