# Stock-Market-Trends-with-Moving-Averages-and-Machine-Learning
This project focuses on stock market analysis and the development of a trading strategy using moving averages, a popular technical analysis tool. The goal is to implement a strategy based on moving average crossovers, where buy and sell signals are generated when a short-term moving average crosses above or below a long-term moving average. This project aims to demonstrate how technical indicators, such as moving averages, can be used to make informed decisions in the stock market.

Moving averages smooth out past price data to help identify trends. A short-term moving average (e.g., 50-day) crossing above a long-term moving average (e.g., 200-day) generates a buy signal, indicating an upward trend. Conversely, when the short-term moving average crosses below the long-term moving average, it generates a sell signal, indicating a potential downward trend. The strategy is designed to capture profits by entering trades during upward trends and exiting during downward trends.

Since moving averages are based on historical price data, they are considered lagging indicators. This means that signals are generated only after a significant price movement has occurred, making it difficult to predict future prices. However, moving averages remain a valuable tool for identifying trends and confirming market conditions.

The project uses Python for analysis, with libraries like Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib/Plotly for visualizing stock prices and moving averages, and Backtrader for backtesting the trading strategy. Historical stock data is collected and processed to calculate moving averages, and buy/sell signals are generated based on the crossovers. The strategy's performance is tested using backtesting, allowing the user to evaluate its effectiveness.

This project demonstrates how moving averages can be used to guide trading decisions in the stock market. It offers a foundation for future improvements, such as integrating other technical indicators, machine learning models, or even live trading systems.
